At first, I wasn't really sure how I was going to approach it. Since I'm not very familiar with assembly programming, and I've never done it on arm before, I was reading up on some resources that would help me start out, such as:
 - [ARM assembler in Raspberry Pi (think in geek)](https://thinkingeek.com/2013/01/09/arm-assembler-raspberry-pi-chapter-1/)
 - [ARM Assembly Basics (azeria labs)](https://azeria-labs.com/writing-arm-assembly-part-1/)
 - [Instruction set reference (arm docs)](https://developer.arm.com/Architectures/A32%20Instruction%20Set%20Architecture#Technical-Information)
 - [Introduction to Computer Organization: ARM Assembly Using the Raspberry Pi (Robert G Plantz)](https://bob.cs.sonoma.edu/IntroCompOrg-RPi/intro-co-rpi.html)

 Once I had the basic workflow working (compilation, linking), it was time to start thinking about what I actually set out to do.
