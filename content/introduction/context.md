This all started with my fascination about the way we are able to use various levels of abstraction and design to create increasingly complex systems. This is of course not exclusive to computer science, and can be observed in many aspects of everyday life, but it is still interesting to think about and appreciate these things when we stumble upon them.

Anyways, that interest led me to enroll in a compilers course for my 3rd year in college. It was interesting, it truly was, but I wanted to do it differently. Instead of doing it in java (as we did), and using libraries (Antlr + an outlined structure to work within), I wanted to see how it would go if I had nothing. You could say that I wanted to start at the bottom, and see how high I could make it.

Another characterization would be that I was developing a compiler as if it happened in the early years of programming language development. (but with a modern cpu architecture, no memory size limitations, ...)
