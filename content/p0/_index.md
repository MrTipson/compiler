> p0 -> assembly, written in assembly

The time came to start working on the *p0* compiler. I wanted to keep things as simple as possible, since writing a parser in assembly didn't seem very fun. With time, it became clear that perhaps I could have added more features, which would have made the *p0* language less verbose and easier to work with in general.
