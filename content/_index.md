Hi, this is a website where I try to explain my thought process that went into making this project. As this is mostly meant as an informational / educational resource, the majority of time will be dedicated to the implementation details/choices.

If there are any mistakes/unclear sections, make an issue. For any other inquiries, contact me on Twitter (@mrtipson) or Discord (MrTipson#2450).
